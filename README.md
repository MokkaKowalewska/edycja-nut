  Website for a small company
</h1>

My new real-world project - website created with React & Gatsby & WordPress as a headless CMS. It's deeply in progress!

## [LIVE](https://wizardly-kowalevski-ce4277.netlify.app/)

## Stack & tools

- HTML
- CSS in JS (styled components)
- React & Gatsby
- GraphQL

## Problems solved

- sourcing from WordPress (I personally think that WP is a poor choice, but I wanted to check, if I'm able to build site on WP with basically no knowledge of PHP)
- CI with Netlify by adding WebHook to Netlify and WordPress, deploy also triggered by gatsby build command and pushing to GitHub (obviously)
- rendering Button component as an anchor element or as gatsby Link
- start unit testing with JEST
